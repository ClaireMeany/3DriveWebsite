			<h2> Features </h2>
			<p> 3Drive is a student project that allows you to upload, store, and
				view obj files. In order to store files, you must first create an account.
				Without an account, you can still temporarily upload and view a file.
				In any case, your device and browser must support OpenGL and JavaScript
				in order to use the viewer.
		 	</p>
			<p>
				The viewer has four tabs of tools: transform, edit lighting, edit
				material, edit lighting, and save image. The transform tab allows
				you to move, rotate, and scale your object. The material tab has options
				to change the color and roughness of your object's material. The
				lighting tab allows you to change the color, intensity, and position of
				the lights in your scene. The ability to load diffuse textures is still
				being implemented. The save image tab is also under construction,
				but will allow you to save a rendered image of your object. If you are
				logged in, it will also allow you to set the object's thumbnail image.
